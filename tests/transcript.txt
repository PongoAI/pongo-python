Speaker 0:

Themselves and maybe more information about our session today.

Speaker 1:

Hello. I don't know if Brandon is Going to speak immediately, but, we are excited to, be here for a 3rd Saturday in a row, and to spend the next 4 hours together, learning and, and exploring, what we can do and how we can support our students to move forward and grow in their English language acquisition. And, hopefully, we are going to add to what the standards already, have, delineated for us and, be able to add that culture piece and that sense of Supporting our students, personal growth, not only as speakers, learners of English, but also as participants in their new cultural environment and society. So, today is going to be a very practical day, And, with a lot with 3 practica, with a lot of hands on experiences. And, I believe Tonya and I are ready to hit the button off and share our screen and get going.

Speaker 2:

Yes. We are. Welcome, everybody. Happy Saturday. We're glad that you're back with us.

If we have any new people, we're glad that you're joining us. So, we will get started with our day 3 on designated English language development. The learning objectives today are are focused really on one primary mode of communication, and that's what we'll be working with today and we'll build on that mode next time. So our goal in our work together today is that by the end of today, that you're able to differentiate content, processes, and products that are necessary to meet the specific developmental needs and communicative needs of your students in the interpretive mode of communication. So that is our primary and also that you're able to explore models with us today of a natural progression of activities that allows for your students to make meaning of language and culture found within authentic resources, resources that are not necessarily produced for teaching in order to be able to advance their EL proficiency, again, in the interpretive mode of communication.

So these are our our learning objectives for today. And the next time that we meet will be focused on the other 2 modes, the collaborative and the productive. So our agenda is on the screen. We do oh, go ahead, Samantha. That's fine.

Speaker 1:

We you will notice That, we have 3, practica planned for us. And, we are looking at the interpretive models at at our students interacting with texts in English, as before, during, and after sequence. In other words, planning how to prepare them for the interaction, planning for their successful in, interaction with the text during, examination and exploration of the text and then wrapping it up and Sam, exploring the possibilities of what happens after they have interpreted this the text and still engaging in interpretive mode.

Speaker 2:

Exactly. And then and then we'll finish with circling back to practicing with Uflow, and and and using the Uflow tool in different ways to support your learning in between these times that we meet and and then beyond. And so we actually are going to start By inviting you to connect with each other in a breakout, going back and and considering discussing language functions, structures related to those, and vocabulary. So in small groups, you're going to think about Functions, vocabulary, structures. Functions are to vocabulary.

Vocabulary is to structures. How do these correlate? How How do functions and structures and vocabulary support one another? And how does our planning, very intentional Planning around the language functions our students will use and their connected structures and vocabulary support their language development. So we want to just remind you on the bottom of the screen, day 2, you shared what you created in in practicum 3 and practicum 4.

And so it might be helpful to go back to your practicum document, and pull that up from day 2 to just Refresh your memory as to what you created there as you share with your colleagues. K? So how do how do functions, vocabulary, and structures Relate to each other in supportive language development is the prompt, and I'm gonna open the rooms. And I set these up so that you could choose your own rooms. And so, in fact, I think for some people, it might be easier if I stop sharing the screen so that you can find Zoom controls.

And so if you need help finding your own room, you just go across the bottom of the Zoom screen. If you don't see breakouts, Then you click more and choose breakout rooms, and then you can scroll down and choose a room to join. Some of you might Be here with team members that you'd like to go into a group together, so you can join your room. And we're gonna give about 10 minutes for this activity.

Speaker 1:

And this is to reconnect with what we did on day 2, so we can continue building on that both skill and knowledge that, we, practiced, in date.

Speaker 2:

So the rooms are open. And if you need help finding how to join, let us know. We can help you out.

Speaker 1:

It it will be especially, useful if, completely new to, This setting people join rooms that, with people who have experienced days 1 and 2. Make arrangements among yourselves if you want to be with specific people.

Speaker 2:

And and they it looks like our groups are doing that. Maybe behind the scenes, they're texting everyone.

Speaker 1:

K. That's all good.

Speaker 2:

I'm gonna pause the recording while the group's in the breakout if

Speaker 1:

Just to To warm up to the ideas, just return to them.

Speaker 2:

Okay. Perfect. Everyone is back From the breakout room, so welcome back. Hopefully you got to connect with colleagues and and share your thinking and your ideas around how language functions and structures and vocabulary support one another in our planning. And as Svetlana mentioned going into this breakout, the goal is really to think about the work that we've been doing, connect back to that with our minds so that we can then build on that today and the work we're doing grounded in the interpretive mode of communication.

And so we are Going to also just very briefly before we get into the interpretive mode, just to review a little bit on the proficiency levels and modes, so that we're really keeping our eyes on what our students know and can do with language, in in the modes and proficiency levels. So here on the screen you'll remember, you probably are very familiar with this proficiency continuum and this gives us our ELD proficiency level descriptors, particularly moving from the left side here with emerging as they're just Entering, emerging, all the way across to that exiting from bridging. And then we can't forget being lifelong language learners. And and part of our work as language teachers is reminding our students that we're always going to be learning language, and and helping them to feel comfortable with Navigating when we don't understand. It's it's part of being a good language learner.

And so we wanted to just remind you that As our students are developing their English language proficiency, they come with us to us maybe as newcomers. And maybe they don't have a lot of English language, but they have a lot of assets to offer in their home language and experiences that they've had. And so we have to remember that just because they can't produce English at high levels doesn't mean they can't think at high levels. And so when we're planning for language development, we're cognizant of that and making sure that when we are guiding our students Using language in each mode of communication and in reading, writing, speaking, and listening that we're keeping our our Planning mind also on moving students from lower order to higher order thinking skills even when they're on the lower side of this proficiency level, continuum. The other piece oh, go ahead, Svetlana.

Speaker 1:

It it is it is Probably important also to, recognize that depending on the situation, the setting in which our students are, required to engage do English because of cultural Challenges or topic challenges, regardless of how Advanced their level of proficiency is, by testing, It may immediately drop to the next lower level of proficiency because of that effective filter, that we so often speak about. So confronted with unfamiliar topic, unfamiliar situations, the level of proficiency shifts down by probably half a half a level or So

Speaker 2:

And I moved us right to this next slide as you were speaking about that, Svetlana, because it connects to, it kind of some general guidelines, not just for the language that students use and those building blocks of language moving up the proficiency level continuum, but the level of scaffolding. So these are just general guidelines that Come from not just the ELD standards, but the ELAELD framework. But we need to remember exactly as Svetlana was sharing. This is the level of scaffolding and support that students may need is going to change the moment that they're dealing with something unfamiliar, The moment that they're dealing with something that is abstract, not concrete, then they're probably going to need more support. So even when we're looking at an e l three or four where they may need light to minimal support for something familiar, they may need additional Or and we wanna be planning for that.

Do you wanna add anything to the building blocks before we go?

Speaker 1:

I I I think we have, we have shared This particular table with, our participant, and it is the briefest, shortest, and most, content loaded, cheat sheet that we've created because it really helps. I have it in front of me at in school When I'm planning or and at home when I'm planning, activities for students because I always have to remember, okay, I'm asking them to do this, And they do it when they're just at the sentence level. Am I asking them to do something that requires paragraph? So I kinda back off and redesign my activities. So This is helpful.

I hope it's helpful for all of you too.

Speaker 2:

You do, and I like to have reminders like that in front of my face 2. Now just very briefly again connecting back to the modes of communication. In in terms of our ELD standards, and in fact, I'll just Go to our next slide here. We need to remember that, yes, we have three parts of those ELD standards where The students interact in meaningful ways. They learn about how English works, and they use foundational literacy skills.

And we have this big huge arrow on part 1 because students learn about how English works or how to use English in specific ways and develop those foundational literacy skills by using English to interact in meaningful ways. And so just like any other state adopted or even nationally adopted standards, we separate out all of these pieces of standards for Ease of presentation. But these elements of the standards, these parts of the standards work in tandem together. And instruction, they're really not separated. And so For it for language learning and focusing on developing English language proficiency, we wanna focus on using the language in those three modes of communication.

And, we wanna just remind you that within those three modes, our students are actually developing literacy skills. Right? They're reading, writing, speaking, and listening across these modes, thus supporting the common core state standards for ELA, for example, and and then also supporting the the language development and content knowledge in these other subject areas through the work we do with them in our designated time with them. And, again, we do that through the modes. How are they making sense, making meaning of what they're reading and viewing and listening to?

How are they collaborating with others and using language in these specific ways to collaborate around content? Right? That's what we collaborate around. And what kinds of products are they producing to really showcase all of their learning. And so this is all through the lens of the modes of communication.

And and so we will, move into looking specifically, as we mentioned, at the interpretive mode of communication. And, the bulk of our time together now actually, I I almost all of the rest of our time together now, we'll be focused on models and activities, to support interpretation, to support the use of interpretive skills and development of, English language proficiency in the interpretive mode of communication. Do you wanna take this one, Tatiana?

Speaker 1:

Sure. So we would like together and we've done this before, on our day 1 when we looked at the three modes of communication together. Now today, we're just going to, focus on the interpretive. We want to recognize the, little a symbol, with the learner in the center of everything that we do. And the three arrows going into the learner's TED into the learner's mind as, symbols of the information that, texts in the English language, present to the learner.

The interpretive mode of communication happens through reading of such texts, viewing of such texts, and listening to such texts. And when we say texts, that means printed online, visual, texts and, and and symbols that, pertain to the English language. The important thing is not to be confused, of course, with the term Interpretation. Interpretation in our world of, as a mode of language, as a mode of communication, does not mean translation. It means understanding and analyzing the text, the information that comes through the text in English.

So it's important to to to disconnect from that idea of translation. So we are going to invite you, to look at, 5, I believe, 5 options. And, now I am inviting you to do something very important. I know it is difficult for us, as teachers at in such a setting where we're learning, to disconnect from that teacher persona. But I would like you to do exactly this.

I I know you cannot see me because I'm I have this background, but I want you to kinda Grab the your teacher hat. Lift it and put it aside, And I would like you to put on your private persona hat. The person who likes reading books or crocheting or gardening. Whatever you you are as a private persona, please put that hat on. And so in your personal life, not your teacher life, and we should be able for healthy living to separate these 2.

For in your personal life, how do you, what do you do? How do you demonstrate understanding after you have maybe read the newspaper, Look for information on a website. Listen to a radio traffic report. Hear someone tell a story. Watch a play, a movie, or a TV show, and you can look at it as Listen to a blog, to to to to a podcast.

Anything that requires of you to interact with information. How do you know and how do you show? How do you demonstrate that you have understood what you have taken in. Please use number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the chat and, choose at least one of these 5 and tell us how it happens for you personally.

Speaker 2:

And we have a pretty small group. So if you would prefer instead of flooding the chat to unmute and speak, we welcome your voices.

Speaker 1:

Thank you, Melissa. Mhmm.

Speaker 2:

Thank you, Isamu.

Speaker 1:

So what do you do, Denise?

Speaker 3:

Mhmm. With what?

Speaker 1:

You say I learned by doing. So what do you do to show that you've learned?

Speaker 3:

I I practice it. Whatever it is that that the lesson or the thing that I am focused on or

Speaker 1:

It's the newspaper. It's the newspaper, let's say. Uh-huh.

Speaker 3:

Uh-huh. What how would I do with the newspaper?

Speaker 1:

Uh-huh.

Speaker 3:

Like, to understand it, then I would go and, like, maybe go and translate it, look up words, Just read it as it is and see what I can gather from that.

Speaker 1:

Okay. Okay.

Speaker 3:

Newspaper in a different language, then I would have to use my linguistic background and just figure out what I already know and see if I can make sense of it.

Speaker 1:

Great. Thank you. Mhmm.

Speaker 2:

We talk to others about what we watch, Give commentary about the situation. I get yelled at about that in my house, number 4. Or number 5, I'm watching something, and I'm yelling at the People, like, they can hear me. We retell the story. Nice hearing someone telling the story.

Speaker 1:

Okay. Monica, Ask what I'm looking for and think keywords. Okay. Yeah. K.

Speaker 2:

Or we post about something. Right? So we post about a play or a movie or a TV show, mhmm, in our real lives.

Speaker 1:

K. Okay. Now I am going to be very express my disappointment, and I'm sure Tanya Byron shares my disappointment. Nobody said anything about writing an essay Or writing a book report or a website report, and you guys are

Speaker 2:

Not cool learners. Nobody created a PowerPoint based on the newspaper. I know.

Speaker 1:

What's wrong with you people? Okay. So, we, we are here to establish together That, reading and demonstration of comprehension of interpretation, Listening, viewing, and demonstration of comprehension and interpretation happens multiple times on daily basis for all of us as participants in various settings. And so We, are here to, suggest that We in the classroom, we must recreate the world of outside, the world the real world Where our students will be expected and charged with imp interpretation tasks that will be different from the classroom, write an essay, read the book, write an essay, situation. And so We are going to, suggest, a diverse, set of activities that are going to support that, learning and interpretation, and and simulate real world, tasks for interpretation.

Speaker 2:

And I think, just before I click on the next slide yes. Jennifer. Yeah. I know. Right?

And and, yeah, students do need to write paragraphs, and they write essays. They may write reports in in different ways for different purposes. But we have to be asking ourselves, how can I integrate, other types of tasks as well that give students an opportunity, to demonstrate their understanding in other ways and more authentic ways so that they're practicing English Not just in this academic context of our classroom and the way we write there, but then beyond so that they so that those language skills transfer too? And so we have there are a lot of different ways that we could, present the interpretive mode of communication and the models that we're going to be working with today. But what we decided to do was to really look at supporting literacy development and putting our models sort of through that lens of literacy development.

And so what you're seeing here are, is is an a brief kind of visual for Developing literacy, with before, during, and after types of strategies, activities that engage students in different ways with the text that they're working with. Now you could call it before, during, and after. You might have heard it called into, through, and beyond, but this is a way of working with and tackling resources before, and then during while we're working with the resource, and then afterward, what are we doing with that to support language comprehension and leading toward production, which we'll look at next time. So what you're seeing here is, We have sort of an instructional framework, and we start with before activities in our sequence. So before our students are reading or viewing or listening to a resource, we really want to make sure that we are establishing purpose for what it is that we're going to be doing with this resource.

And in that, we're activating prior knowledge or connecting to background knowledge that they may already have. We're helping to motivate students. Hopefully, what we're doing is is relevant to them, and they see the relevance through the before activities that we do, and this guides them into the work we'll be doing with this resource that they're going to read or view or listen to. This before approach also gives us as as Language teachers the opportunity to see if we need to spend some additional time making sure that students are making meaning. Right?

But they do understand what they're going to be working with, in in the way that they need to. Maybe they don't understand every single word, and that's Okay. But it gives us an opportunity to gauge where they are and see if we need to do some work before we get into the text. And then during the reading, we we Svetlana, you look like you wanted to add something there.

Speaker 1:

I I guess I am, fixated, you can say, on the cultural, component of everything we do. And, I want to emphasize that activate prior knowledge means not Just knowledge of the content, but also prior knowledge and experience culturally, and it can be in a completely different culture. So what are the cultural assets, and academic knowledge that our students or content knowledge that our students, bring to the table. That's where we gauge all that. Mhmm.

I'm sorry for interrupting.

Speaker 2:

No. We it's how we work together. And I think that that's a it's it's important to add that piece. And and you you're right. You always remember to bring the culture front and center.

So before students are working with something that they read or view or listen to, we we support that and prepare students for with the resource we're going to be use using. Sorry. And then while we're using the resource, we engage students in a variety of different activities that that really get them working with the resource using the language to show that comprehension in a variety of different ways. And then after we've worked with that resource, We also plan for ways, that we are helping to extend students' language and cultural use around the text, and to help them to further be able to elaborate Their ideas to further use English in different ways connected to what we've done with that text and and others before. And so our as we're looking at the models to come, you'll see that we will start with looking at a variety of before, activities and then move into during and after.

And we're going to give you some time to be able to use these models or bring in your own, to create interpretive activities for your EOs. So we'll start.

Speaker 1:

Here we go. Let's take a look at these, possibilities of, in engaging with Our students before they actually set eyes on a text, and that is, of course, reading, viewing, and listening. For for our purposes today, it will be reading, but also a lot of viewing. So we are In inviting our students to address the story's theme and main idea by, responding, to a question that is related to, the text's theme and main idea. Our example here is, how do you behave when you don't like the job you're supposed to do?

Another possibility in such engagement with the theme and main idea is to take a stance on the issue. And, we're making a statement for our students that they have to respond to, and here's the statement. It's better to have fun today than worry about tomorrow or the next school year. And a third opportunity, a third possibility is, to reflect or journal, their thoughts on the vaccine. And, I'm I'm I'm suggesting a Latin one, but You can be any, any language translated into English.

He who gives promptly, gives double. And so we are going to invite you to practice. And, again, you can use, you can number 1, 2, 3, the question, the statement and the, quotation, the Maxim, the proverb, and respond very briefly. Again, you may unmute and and say something, or you can type it, type, your response to, to the suggestion in the at.

Speaker 2:

So we can reply to any of these 3 in the green?

Speaker 1:

That's right. K. And if you click the, it will invite to participation. Yeah. Thank you, Tanya.

Honesty goes first comes first.

Speaker 2:

I'm pretending, Maybe.

Speaker 1:

Mhmm.

Speaker 2:

Thank you, doctor Ramirez.

Speaker 1:

Let me

Speaker 2:

give my own honest

Speaker 1:

answer. Let's see. Mhmm.

Speaker 2:

Thank you, Linda. When I don't like the job I'm assigned, I try to find a way to complete it right away. Yes. Me too. Eat the frog.

That was what I was trained as as a as a a youngster once. What about our second one? It's better to have fun today than to worry about tomorrow or to worry about Next school year. Chunking the work into manageable parts. Yes.

Speaker 1:

That's smart. Right? Elizabeth, that is smart.

Speaker 2:

I like that too, Denise. Just do it. Right? It just get over get it over with so it doesn't sit there as an annoyance or you feel the weight of it because you know it's there.

Speaker 1:

Mhmm. Mhmm. Mhmm. I ventured into number 2 because nobody's done any, responses to that.

Speaker 2:

Well, actually, you know, What?

Speaker 1:

Oh, did I not read it? I'm sorry.

Speaker 2:

No. Shared that it's not in her nature to just have fun today and not worry about tomorrow.

Speaker 1:

Right. Okay. I'm sorry, Masul. I didn't see that.

Speaker 2:

It's easy to miss when the chat is moving around. That's true.

Speaker 1:

Alright. Thank you for your honest engagement, and, reaction, responses to, to to these three questions. Now am I suggesting do are we suggesting that, we should Use all 3 in class? Maybe yes. And I think it provides for a really nice, Option for kids to interact with the theme and main idea in on their own grounds, by their own comfort level.

I noticed that, not many people looked into 2, but a lot of 1, a lot of enough of 3. And so, that kind of variety, is going to allow, open more doors for our students' engagement, in interpretation of text. Okay? And inter an engagement with the theme, preparing for the theme and main idea of our story.

Speaker 2:

And, actually, Svetlana, there was a quick question from the chat, and I respond quickly in the chat, but maybe we could elaborate a little. Sure. Question is would would the before activities be the same as or in addition to activating and fortifying background knowledge? And so, I just wanted to circle back to that because it is part of what we do in these before activities. We're connecting to to prior experiences.

We're connecting to background knowledge, and, yes, fortifying where we can. So not just activating, but fortifying. Absolutely, miss Smith.

Speaker 1:

And validating.

Speaker 2:

Mhmm.

Speaker 1:

That is where the human moment comes. The the building of character recognition of character and building of character. Because oftentimes, we're so fixated on learning the language, getting the right GPA, And that that that we forget about, how important it is for this human to Breathe more freely in our classrooms and reminisce about, their their childhood and how they did things, in a different place, in a different world, in a different time. K.

Speaker 2:

I think speaking of that, it's a good time to come to these images.

Speaker 1:

Absolutely. And so, here is another way to activate prior knowledge and experience and validate, validate, validate. We are showing you, 6 images, that We, would like you to explore, examine, and, so we show These images, we may play a song, that may evoke feelings, or we can show there are 2, videos, Links to 2 short videos, at the bottom that can work, similarly, to This next activity, which is here to trigger memories, emotions, thoughts, and reflections. So we're inviting you to take a look at the 6 pictures. You may compare them horizontally, vertically, any 2.

You can group them. You can You you can focus on just one and tell us why This is important that this attracted this picture attracted your attention, but we're inviting you To look at the 6 pictures and react, respond to all 6, Just one or any number in between. You may unmute and speak. You may type. And we can number the pictures as 123456, And you can play with the numbers that way.

If there is one particular picture that, has moved you Particularly. Would you care, agree to share about it? And you can unmute and speak if that's the case.

Speaker 2:

Okay. I'm wondering if I can and and I see the The the current response, the most recent that it's about, all of them, motivation.

Speaker 1:

Motivation for what, if I may ask for some clarification. Thank you, Denise. Linda, we the the the objective is to look at these and be humans, moved by, visuals. So, what what which picture Grabbed your attention and moves you in particular way. Maybe you remember something from childhood, maybe something you saw 2 weeks ago.

That that that is the objective, if if if, I may say so. I want to, point out that what I typed, earlier, and I said one Pictures 1, 2, 3, the top pictures are all about music and dancing, so it's play. And the bottom three pictures, up the the bottom three pictures, working creatively. The bottom three pictures are hard work, carrying wood, picking up crops, and, you know, working, on the dry, Dusty, patch of land, in the Is it possible that the top three pictures, also represent work? And I

Speaker 3:

think they do. The first one, you see the cup there for tips, The second one, the girls look like they're having fun, but you see they're they're a crowd. So they're probably working for tips as well as the the third guy. They're all on the street.

Speaker 1:

That's right. These are street musicians earning their living just in a different way, and we all benefit from, what What they're putting out in the street or sitting around the corner, and, of course, who says that The people working hard in the bottom, three pictures are not singing to keep the rhythm, to to to cheer themselves up and to recognize the blessing of being employed. So, it is not All, two sided, black and white. There are there is so much overlap between, what we call play and what we call hard work. Okay?

And this is the kind The kind of conversation we can have with our students.

Speaker 2:

Yeah. And, Martin Martin shared, for life and culture, we need we all need this from each job. They complement each other. Right? So we can be working very, very hard and still enjoying ourselves and our company.

I'm at the hard work.

Speaker 1:

Exactly. Keep that thought. Thank you for that. How the the two rows complement each other. Okay.

And, we don't have, Jennifer. I agree. We don't but On the other hand, we don't have much, much background, about these, pictures, And, it is what do we know? That but the interpretation is always, available. Okay.

So Any set of pictures. These 6 pictures and the 2 videos, serve, the purposes because they They interact with they represent the theme and main ideas of, the story that we will be reading together. And, of course, you have to find other pictures, other videos to match the theme and main idea of, the text that you will be offering to your students. K? Moving on.

In this and the beauty of using, pictures like this, is We learn so much about our students. In the past, we have had, participants share about their childhood and how they have grown up had grown up with parents working in the fields and them as young children, helping their parents after school, picking lettuce, picking grapes. And so that that is a powerful way of connecting with our students and, again, validating their history, validating their humanity. So we're moving on to the next slide. Okay.

But, Tonia, would you like to work with this one?

Speaker 2:

Sure. So here, you're seeing activities focused on, teaching the vocabulary in context. And so here, an example of that is related to teaching literary terms. And, of course, we know that our students need to learn these terms, just as part of their English language development and success, also on the ELPAC, requires some understanding of a variety of different terms. Rather than giving, well, I I I'll back that up.

Keeping it focused on Teaching these terms in context and giving students examples of what these look like, is a really positive way of helping to support their meaning making, and being able to connect language with structures, with the vocabulary, all in the context of what we're working with. So here the focus is on a fable, And so that would be our literary term. So you can see in the image on the left side a definition of what a fable is, and that, and then it goes on to maybe discuss, the ways that we can use fables and the ways that Fables are written that may bring in elements such as, giving animals human qualities, for example, as we see in this image, here on the screen. Fables often also illustrate some kind of moral lesson. Right?

And so in the image here, we can see, that we have 2 insects in this image, But we have one that's standing here on his feet, the other sitting in a chair. It looks like they're in their own little insect home. And so we're getting to not only present or begin to connect to to the reading, which is a fable, but also showing, the ways that that we present language and the ways that fables represent the characters within them. And and what you see on the right hand side is, a much more academic approach to presenting some information around one of the characters in the fable. And so these are, the sick I say cicada.

Svetlana, you say cicada, don't you?

Speaker 1:

Yes. Yeah. I do. But they do. Yeah.

Speaker 2:

And and so we can see that it's a cicada that's in the image over here from this very famous fable. But then we also have some more academic images of the cicada, And we could present some more academic related information, around this fable that we're going to be introducing and reading with students. Svetlana, would you add to that?

Speaker 1:

No. It is just We have, learned that, juxtaposing, comparing concepts, and interpretations of concepts, really support student learning and retention of knowledge and skill. So, discussing insects, as characters in the story and discussing insects as items on the scholarly, in the scholarly research or article, helps their understanding of no. We may be using the story may be using the word cicada, but it is not as the same as a science article. It is actually telling you about people, and it makes for a better understanding of that, what a fable does.

The concept, the literary term of fable.

Speaker 2:

Thank you. Now do you want to share the fable yet?

Speaker 1:

No. Not yet.

Speaker 2:

Not yet yet. Okay. Okay. Okay. Another activity that helps to build vocabulary and make sense of vocabulary, demonstrate comprehension of vocabulary, is using the Frayer model, which, As we're as we're sharing different strategies, not all of these will be brand new to people.

If you've been teaching, hopefully, you've been using some of these, right, in different ways. So we like to bring some strategies that are tried and true strategies, and I think the Frayer model is one of those. Now what we have here on the screen is building toward, working in collaborative mode in a variety of different ways. But first, we can work together to make sense of language in groups, and that it is with a focus on comprehension. So maybe we select the key vocabulary and we give students, the graphic organizer that you see on the screen and ask them to work together to complete it.

So we first model the process of how to complete, this organizer. And then we have our students get into their groups, and they're they're able to work together with the word assigned so that they can Talk to each other about how this word is defined and come up with an image or characteristics or both to represent the word, giving examples, and maybe even identify how this word that they're given relates to other words. So it could be word clusters, word families. You can change this up in a variety of ways. So the goal is on helping them to think about this vocabulary and make meaning, understand it, comprehend it, which is why we have it here in the interpretive strategies, and then we'll build into the collaborative, the next time that we're working together.

I filled no. I didn't miss a click. Sorry.

Speaker 1:

No. No. You're you're you did a good job. Yes. Okay.

And

Speaker 2:

And Go ahead. Oh, sorry. I was just going to mention, that I am copying a link to just that example of a Frayer model template for you into the chat. And so you will be able to go in and change it however you want and use it with your own students without having to search it out. Sorry.

I didn't mean to No.

Speaker 1:

No. You're I I had forgotten about, this link. So, another true and tried and true and working, activity, strategy is the Very familiar. KWL chart. What I know, what I want to know, and what I learned.

When I was first exposed to this, oh my God, I was in love with it. And I started using it, and I am the teacher who's guilty of starting it and never returning it to it to finish. Now I've become much more disciplined in my interaction with this strategy. So, in our case, it will be what I know and what I want to know about, hard work and helping one another. And, maybe that's where we will leave it, and then we will return to it when we're done with our reading.

We want to offer to you another exploration, of both vocabulary And what it what looks like just a vocabulary, a bunch of vocabulary words, also provokes brainstorming, contemplation, reflection, and speculation about what is coming, our way as learners. So here is our, vocabulary pyramid, and, we we invite our students to predict What is the story all about, by looking at these, these vocabulary words? Another wonderful, way to explore the words is to invite our students to group them, sort them out by whatever criterion they may choose. Okay? So we are inviting you to do exactly that.

Either predict about our story or group the words by whatever criterion you choose to group them. K? You can unmute and speak or type in the chat, compose a sentence or a list of words, group a list of words, and tell us what what what, characteristic, they share in order to belong together in a group.

Speaker 2:

Yeah. Denise, I think of country life too when I look at so many of these words. And, doctor Ramirez has a question, Svetlana. When you do this Activity, are the words randomly placed, or do they have meaning based on where they are in this No.

Speaker 1:

They're randomly they're randomly placed. So Just my my criterion is graphically how do they look? Can I put them space them out in a decent, in a decent, pyramid?

Speaker 2:

Yes, Jennifer. Seasonal activities may be Nice. Mhmm. Lorena, your question is fantastic. It's you're reading our minds probably.

From Lorena, do you recommend teachers include images next to the words? Svetlana, do you wanna address that?

Speaker 1:

It is you know your students best. If you, some words as we know, abstract words are very difficult to illustrate, but many of these are very concrete and kinda on purpose. So, yes, you can you can match them with images. You can just Put, if if you can if you're strong with images, you can probably just make a pyramid of images and have the students match, the images with a word bank that you provide them. It is, the the possibilities are Un unlimited, because you know your now, and The bottom line is you are, pushing so many buttons in their thinking before they have even set their eyes on the text.

Right? Absolutely. Especially for, LPAC 12, I I absolutely agree. You Pictures always help. Absolutely, Jennifer.

Seasons are very Talking about California. Right?

Speaker 2:

I think that's a really important piece, though, that comes up in in when you're working with Students on this who are coming from various places. You may have students who are from maybe Argentina where the seasons Christmas happens like, it it's summertime for them in December. So that that's a really important cultural piece and experiential piece that may prompt students to share their experiences and use more language.

Speaker 1:

Alright. Of course. Okay.

Speaker 4:

Reason I bring that up is because I had to explain snow this week.

Speaker 1:

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Speaker 4:

And explaining snow. I'm like, you know snow? And I translated it, and they were like, no. And I'm like, oh, okay. So let me show you where snow is and what snow is.

Because having a word for it does not give, you know, the same, Hopefully, lighting background that, you know, the light goes on. Oh, it's just it just requires translation. No. They had no experience with it.

Speaker 1:

Did you bring a nice shaving machine

Speaker 2:

to to answer that question. Picture of my friend's car.

Speaker 4:

She was caught in the snowstorm. She's a 911 operator in Tennessee, and it snowed on them last week in Tennessee.

Speaker 1:

Oh, Tennessee.

Speaker 4:

Her front door, and then there's nothing out there but white. This is her car. There's nothing on top of

Speaker 2:

it, but

Speaker 4:

it's not Right. They got heat of snow. And so she said she's

Speaker 1:

the Thank you.

Speaker 4:

To the 911 center because it was just so bad.

Speaker 5:

Oh my goodness.

Speaker 1:

Exactly. There many of our kids have no I mean, even if they were born and raised in California, especially because we are in Southern California, how many of our kids have been up in the mountains, skiing. I don't think so.

Speaker 4:

I took a I took a group 1 year because I'm like, you guys know snow it's snowing up Okay. And they they didn't. And so I was like, okay. I Got it. We did a field trip.

We had 5 teachers. Awesome. You're amazing. 15 passenger vans.

Speaker 2:

Oh my goodness.

Speaker 1:

Go ahead, Lauren.

Speaker 5:

Thank you. Something that I I wanted to point out or bring up is, I encourage, teachers to have sentence frames To go along with, any type of when they're encouraged to speak and to have differentiated sentence frames For this

Speaker 1:

Of course. Of course. Again, you know your students Predicting out of the vocabulary pyramid, you depending on the proficiency level, We can, we can provide, these sentence frames, or if they're they're if the students are, ELPAC 1, we can simply ask them, to group the words or help them Group the words by words for season and climate, words for, what happens in the weather, how we feel, and and things of that sort. Very, very ac thank you, Lorena.

Speaker 2:

Yeah. I was just gonna say too. Thank you, Lorena. And and here we're focused on interpretive. Right?

We're focused less on language production and more on comprehension and making meaning out of these words. Right? So not just grouping them, but, there are so many ways that we could do this, like, especially for newcomers and lower proficiency level using images with words. Not asking them to produce so much, but to sequence, to order, to connect, and show their understanding with these words. So some of those the on the lower proficiency levels, absolutely, they need more support, than just Throwing the words out here and saying, what do you think?

Right? So thank you for bringing us back to that, Lorena.

Speaker 1:

Kids can be matching pictures as we already said with the with the words, and then below the pictures, We can expect just labeling or simple sentences. Again, the the the variations are quite limitless. Endless. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Speaker 2:

I I find that myself, I'm often limited most by my own thinking. Uh-huh. And so it's why I love collaborating with other teachers because we get so many great ideas. And, and and, actually, I know that I'm speaking for Svetlana as well. She and I have worked together for many, many years.

It's it's a huge Part of the reason why we make sure to include practice, giving time to not just practice and apply on your own, but then time also to Share with others and get ideas and say, oh, I hadn't thought of that. And so that's all part of, the work that we hope to do with you today. Yeah. It definitely helps to think out loud and co construct the possibilities. And together, we're better.

Right? And

Speaker 1:

that's exactly where we're going.

Speaker 2:

Exactly. And and so we're going to, move into this interpretive activity. So all of our practica today are focused on the interpretive mode, but here we're focused on those before activities. What are different ways that we can activate prior knowledge, connect to background knowledge, motivate students, and and fortify what they already know in preparation for building on that with the work we'll do with the reading or viewing or listening. So the instructions that you have on, on the screen, I put in the chat, but I'm gonna pause there for a moment.

Linda, did you have a question for us? I see you're looking for where's the raise hand symbol, so I'm assuming that's because you have a question. Yeah. I'm gonna save my question. Go ahead and continue.

Speaker 1:

Okay. Oh, okay.

Speaker 2:

Okay. Okay. So we we're inviting you to move into this Time for practice here. I'm gonna give you about 20 minutes for this one. The instructions are in the chat for you.

And, again, we're gonna give you a a practica document for day 3, and it's a forced copy as it has been. And and so let me just drag that document to the screen so you'll see it here. And we're just working on, again, practicum 5, And those are the before activities. So you're going to modify you're going to take a look. You can use our the we shared, from the before activities and or you can think of something else that you've done as a before reading, viewing, listening activity.

And so you're going to identify the activity in the box and then consider what are how can I, modify this so it can be differentiated for 2 different proficiency levels? How could I use this activity for e l ones, And how could I use this for el twos? What would I need to change, in order to differentiate this to support what they're able to do with words and phrases versus sentences, for example. Okay? And so you'll see in the practicum document, that here, you have a link to the before slides that we've been working with.

Because you don't have the full slide deck yet. We wanted to just make sure you have access to be able to look at those slides, refresh your memory. And, again, you can choose 1 Or you can choose something you've done on your own. A lot of you have many of years of teaching experience, so we welcome either or. We'll give you 20 minutes for this.

And before I, before we leave you alone to create, do we have any questions About the activity before we give you the 20 minutes. No? I'm gonna stop sharing the screen because we have the instructions in the chat.

Speaker 1:

And we can stop recording.

Speaker 2:

We can pause it. Yes. And, Maricela, I'm gonna send you a link in just a minute. Give me a second to get it set up for you. Okay?

So 20 minutes will bring you back.

Speaker 1:

I am marking

Speaker 2:

the time?

Speaker 1:

I got the time. It will be at, 211th or 12. Okay. Perfect.

Speaker 2:

So Hi, ladies. Are we gonna be able to share our screen? You yes. Would you and so lots of different Great ideas in the resource. I wanted to make sure it went out to everybody.

Speaker 1:

Mhmm.

Speaker 2:

And I think, Melissa, we can put that into what's been shared by been in the shared folder too. Right? Thank you. Awesome. Okay.

I'm gonna move the timer out of the way. Alright.

Speaker 1:

Welcome back, everybody.

Speaker 2:

And that is going to bring us, transition us this break is transitioning us really from our before student activities into our during, activities for reading, viewing, listening. K?

Speaker 1:

Okay. So now we are diving into the text. We're presenting the text to our students. Before we click on this, I wonder, if we already guessed, what our story, what our fable is about, You can give it a title or just, guess about about it. Okay.

Tanya is going to share the the actual text, of the fable, with us. It's the story the grasshopper and the ants. Exactly, Jennifer. Our title is the ant and the cicada, which is pretty much the same. It is from a wonderful publication, specifically for English language learners.

And the beauty of this, of this book, is that it offers 2 versions of the same story. 1 for beginning learners and one for more advanced learners. So, if you ever have an opportunity, to, find, the stories we, brought with us, Textbook. I call it textbook, by, Silverman and Casir, it it is just a fantastic, resource, for, English language development teachers.

Speaker 2:

So now added that I added that source. Even though it is in the bottom of the story we shared, I

Speaker 1:

added that in the

Speaker 2:

chat while you were talking about it. And, Jennifer, I love that you connect that to Bugs Life because that's what I think of as well.

Speaker 1:

And, so we will give you just a moment to, read through the story. It's a Very brief version of this of of the fable. Read through it, and if if you know the story, no no worries. You don't even need to read, the story. And Tonia placed a link to the, to the text again in the chat.

So as our students are reading the story, we are inviting them to identify the correct information with either or choices. We are providing a graphic organizer, And, we have only placed 4 statements, but, your, graphic organizer can be as extended Extensive, as you wish or as in order to match, the text you're reading with your students. It can be It can be broken down to, scaffolded segments, with additional questions. It's really up to you, the teacher. This is Just to model, the activity, and the graphic organizer, with the type of thinking it requires from our students.

So I want to know, what the ants did all summer long. And our students are going to put a check mark by the either or statement. They worked or sang? And I I will appreciate a shout out shout shout shout it out answer. Tony is not going to give the answers away.

So what did the, what, I want to know what the ants did all summer long. They worked? They worked. Exactly. And I want to know who felt hungry in the cold of winter.

The cicadas. Thank you, Jennifer. Okay. Now and, of course, 2 more questions. We got that.

Now we can, How can we make this, more challenging, and how can we push this toward, a higher order thinking skill is by requesting for our students to indicate, to find a place in the story that is supporting their answer, providing textual evidence. And this is a perfect opportunity to teach our students the term textual evidence, which they will encounter encounter in many, other, subjects and tests that they have to take in the state of California. Now I I will, give you an opportunity to look, into the left hand side column, and think of something that maybe you will you noticed. Make a comment about the language used in the left hand side column.

Speaker 3:

K.

Speaker 1:

I am sure that you are recognizing the usage of indirect questions, which are really difficult for English learners. We learn Direct questions early enough and fast enough. The direct question for number 1 would be, What did the ants do all summer long? But the indirect question, the reported speech question, I want to know what the ants did all summer long is a challenge, especially for students who come from languages, their native languages strongly engaged with the subjunctive mood of verbs. So just a a little hint, a little, this is a thought through.

Now if you want your students to engage with direct questions, go ahead, change that. But, I want to point out what we chose, Tanya Tanya and I, what we chose no. What language And structure we chose, to in to to to include in this graphic organizer. K?

Speaker 2:

Thank you, Svetlana. And the next, activity that we want To highlight in working to develop English language skills is a simple organizer here, Getting at main idea and supporting details. And so here we ask students to use the graphic organizer while they're reading the story. And as they read and maybe they need to read many times, and we should direct them probably to read many times. Right?

So first, we read for the main idea, and then we can circle back, read again, and now find in the story Those supporting details, the the who, the what, the why, the when, the where. And and so this This star, really forms a great graphic organizer that students can fill in. We could make it bigger, so that there's Space for them to actually write within the star. If we wanted to, we can take their completed stars and post them in the classroom as we're working with this specific, reading. And and so we know that graphic organizers aren't something new, but we want to remind everybody That something as simple as this can really help students to revisit the text with multiple purposes, Thus then, exposing them to the language over and over, and going back to find the different details.

The

Speaker 1:

next go ahead. The next graphic organizer uses the same w, 5 w's, that the star suggested to our students. And here, we are asking our kids to respond in just one word, one phrase, no. We are not expecting a full sentence as a response. So asking the Question the questions who, what, when, where, why, we may get this kind of an answer.

And we can start it with them because Just giving them 5 w's is, quite, unnerving, and to open, Open too open ended, to in order to, have a well guided activity. So let's say we can give the word the the first answer, the cicada. So what did the cicada do? The cicada felt very hungry. When was that?

Oh, it was during cold winter, the cold winter. Where was that happening in the field, and why was that happening? Now we have The analysis already churning. He did not gather grain during the summer. Now the why answer can be much shorter, did not gather grain, or a little bit extended as, Tanya clicked.

These 5 answers, we we can provide only We can provide one answer in order to trigger, the kids populating, the other 4. We can start with, felt very hungry, and then the kids will go, oh, yeah. The cicada felt hungry. When, etcetera, everything will fall into place. Now, we can leave this at we can leave this, activity at this, and, of course, we're not suggesting just one, table, one chart, but a sequence of charts that would jack juxtapose, The cicada with the ants.

The 2 the 2 different, time, frames, the, seasons, the the spring, summer and winter, etcetera. Now we can leave it at this, Or we can actually invite our invite our students to use their mini answers as components of a full sentence now, And that would be like a mini practice for their productive mode when for when we will ask them to Juice language in a more formal way. So now when they put these 5 different components together, We can get and, Tanya, don't click because we're going to ask every we're going to ask everybody To come use the 5 answers to compose a sentence out of these two answers out of these 5 answers. You can speak or type.

Speaker 2:

Or you can copy what you saw if you have a photograph Fast dice. Sorry.

Speaker 1:

That's okay. Wait time is the hardest.

Speaker 2:

Especially when we're going and typing in the chat, it takes a little time.

Speaker 1:

But the cicada felt very hungry. Absolutely. Thank you, Melissa. Thank you for Choosing what you chose and not using all 5. Okay?

That is also ah, somebody is on my team. Ivasu? Yes. When Tanya will click eventually. Imasula, I'm sure you have also encountered the protests of, or the, concern of kids, going, oh, but you're not supposed to start the sentence with because.

Okay.

Speaker 2:

Elizabeth, that's a nice complex sentence.

Speaker 1:

Exhausting. Thank you. Wonderful opportunity to open the conversation about, style and, sentence structure and the significance of that with which we open a sentence and close a sentence. So, obviously, the writer wants to emphasize the cause, the because, and so that's why the writer can Experienced writer, has earned the right, to start a sentence with because. And our students Can be that experienced, a writer who has earned the, opportunity to start a sentence with because.

Great. I I love these sentences I see already. Thank you very much for starting them in a very jazzy way, all of you. And so here's our sentence. Mhmm.

Yes, Imasul, starting with because, And, again, an opportunity to discuss the writer's craft and art of writing. Right?

Speaker 2:

And I think it can open the door also to talking about other ways. Right? What are some other words or phrases that we could use to Start a sentence in the same way rather than because. Right? So it opens the door to that too.

Speaker 1:

Okay. Now, Working out our next activity, in a way, may remind again, it is very familiar. True or false? For God's sakes, yes. We have all used that.

But Tony and I slightly modified the activity and, augmented the tasks for the kids, Allowing, the thought processes to become at a higher to go to a higher level. So Let's take a look at what we mean. Let's take a look at question number 1, and please respond at least 1 person so we can actually have an answer. The cicada sang beautiful songs all summer long. Is that true or false?

It's true. It is true. So our students are going to the middle column. They will put a check mark or write the letter t for true, and now they have to give evidence. They have to go to the story, copy a quotation, and add it to, to their answer.

The moment they look for textual evidence that brings, I'm sure in, your, site on your sites and districts, DOK, depth of knowledge measure measures of the that that, platform has been used. So that matrix has been used, and so we are moving into a higher order thinking skill by providing textual evidence. Now let's take a look at question 2. The ant sang and danced with the cicada. Is that true or false?

Speaker 5:

False.

Speaker 1:

False. Thank you for for the answer. It is false. And so now Our students are going to write f for false, and they will go to the, right hand side column and provide the correct answer. So what did the ants actually do, in the summertime?

Speaker 4:

They worked gathering grain.

Speaker 1:

Absolutely. And so you, you answer in your own words. And if we want to Kick it up even further, we can ask students to provide textual evidence along with their own interpretation. The remaining 4, 5, and, of 3 and 4 are more or less the same. Now let's take a look at Question number 5.

The ants help the cicada with food and clothes. Oh, I'm sorry. That that is I I I okay. We can look at this one, but it is, the cicadas helped the cicadas pardon me. The ants helped the cicadas with food and clothes, It and it is it is false.

Okay. Moving on? Mhmm.

Speaker 2:

In this, in this set of activities, we have a couple that we'll take a look at on this screen. And I think that I'll start with sequence and then give it back to Svetlana because she's she's better at the second one. And so we'll start with sequencing. And and this is actually really fantastic, particularly for our students who don't have a lot of language that they're able to produce, but still giving them an opportunity to demonstrate their comprehension of the story in the interpretive mode. So what we ask our students to do, we give them, we ask them as they read to place the pictures provided by us, the teacher, in the correct sequence to follow the actions in the story.

And so as they're reading a lot, we give them the set of pictures. We have a class set, for example, or we have the individual sets to hand out, and they order those pictures as they, go through the story. And for us, as we're circulating, we're able to see But they are making sense of the story. They are able to sequence the pictures we've given them in the correct order without asking them to produce any language. The second is the The 2 or 3 entry dialectical journal.

Speaker 1:

That is right. A dialectical journal is a fantastic, graphic organizer, And I'm sure, once we show you the, columns in it, you will recognize it by probably a different name. So as our students are reading, we are asking them to maintain the dialectical, dialectical journals, by whatever parameters the teachers, the teacher has set. They can copy a passage, quotation, from, the story and, write it in the left hand side column. And then in The right hand side, they can we are giving them, sentence starters.

As I read, I think that. As I read, I feel that. I, as I read, I remember when. I like actually, using a 3 column, dialectical journal, where the middle column is nothing more than a summary of a paragraph or when I read a longer pass a longer with my students. Juxtaposing summary in the middle to reflection or analysis, to the right, supports their understanding of what it is to analyze and reflect versus summarize.

Oftentimes, when we ask our students to analyze, they give us a summary of what they read. And so asking them to do both, They cannot type the same or write the same thing twice. Right? So keep this in mind. Or if you want to focus on summary, which is a fantastic way of, checking our students' understanding of a story.

If you want to have a summary of a paragraph 1, paragraph 2, in the right hand side column, of course, go for that. It's just another way to organize and have a conversation with the text. A dialectical journal is just one more form of what we teachers of reading know as active reading. Highlighting passages and responding to them in the margin, that we good readers do on automatic. Exactly, Elizabeth.

Text to self connections. Exactly. Claiming ownership of the text. Because ultimately, I, the reader, Am always the main character in a story.

Speaker 2:

I love that. And it actually helps students to connect to their background knowledge, their prior experiences, and so helps to boost that relevance for them, hopefully, when they are able to connect with the reading. I think this actually brings us into our next practice. Right? Yes.

Speaker 1:

It does. Exactly.

Speaker 2:

So I will Pull the practice activity instructions up on the screen. The instructions are really similar to practicum 5. The only difference is now you are focusing on using one of the during activities that we have just been exploring together. So focusing on how we can support The demonstration of comprehension and development of interpretive skills, during the reading, during viewing, during listening is the focus. So, again, you're going to either take one of the models, and and use that in your practica document, Modify it for 2 different proficiency levels.

Or, again, you're very welcome to take something else that you use, and, again, model it, or I'm sorry, modify it for 2 different, proficiency levels. We are going to allot the same amount of time as we did in the first practica?

Speaker 1:

Do wait, Fatima. Thinking that I was thinking that we could possibly Work with 25 minutes, Johnny.

Speaker 2:

Okay. So so Just the thought of the day. No. I think that we do have Time to be able to to do that. The last thing we want is for everybody to feel rushed.

Mhmm. And and so sometimes it takes time to find other resources if that's what you're going to use as well. So 25 minutes sounds great.

Speaker 1:

Yeah.

Speaker 2:

And, actually, the breakout rooms are already open. I had reopened them and and left them open. So they're open for you now. And so you can self select again.

Speaker 1:

Everybody. Thank you, Melissa. Everybody is back, and, Tanya will resume sharing her screen. We've developed this routine, so I much rather have her share her screen, since she has the 2 screens and I don't.

Speaker 2:

I Do, and I, thank you for pulling me back from the breakout system. Fine. Yeah. Okay. I have my timer.

Thank you. I'm glad you did, or we'd still be in a breakout right now. Oh, yeah. Alright.

Speaker 1:

Easy to do that.

Speaker 2:

It is. It is. And so moving from our practicum activity, we will go right into After. So what what are the what are some ideas and models for activities that we can do with students after we've done the reading and the viewing and the listening, Supporting all of the work that we've done so far.

Speaker 1:

I have, pretty much created this, the the sequence of activities, because of my Latin kids' needs. When we read a text in Latin and whether it's in English or French or whichever language, when we read a text, Good readers visualize characters and places, and then they put these characters and places into action. And so in order to support students' ability, students' skill to respond, on automatic, if you will, to the text in such manners, I actually physically ask my students tangibly on a piece of paper, Ask my students to drop pictures of these characters. We'd agree that we are movie makers and that they have to hire a bunch of factors to play the main parts, the and how much budget they're going to do. And so this is my little make believe, Hollywood, setting for them.

And then they have to hire set designers to design the sets, the places where and give them instructions, to where, characters will be interacting. And so once we identify characters and places and draw little sick figure pictures of those or better. Some kids are so much more talented. We engage. We put these characters and places into action.

I typically because I read small paragraphs with my students, especially by younger learners of Latin. I I use a 3 frame storyboard, where they have to do a beginning, middle, and end representation of the interaction of characters. But, of course, depending on how advanced your students are, how in how much depth and detail you want to engage them, you can provide them with a 5, frame storyboard, etcetera. I like the odd number storyboards frames in a storyboard because it gives the kids that sense of middle. What happens in the middle?

It's a physical middle, And it works. Also, just from experience, I I I really hold their hand when we do the first storyboard, because I ask them to draw a picture of the beginning, the most important scene from the beginning, And then I invite them to do the most important, scene of the end at the end. And only after that, now that they're framed by the beginning and end of the story, I encourage them, instruct them to portray the middle. Sometimes they need to do a split screen, and they they become so creative with what they do. Because if you don't do the end, as a as a marker of the border, kids will end up needing 77 frames Because they want to draw a picture of every detail that happened.

Okay? So start with the beginning, Jump to the end, and only after that, go to the middle. A very practical, tip that I'm sharing with you. Once they're done with the, with the pictures, they can either copy from the text an actual quotation to support their understanding, to support their visual representation, or they can start Practicing produces producing small volumes of language and writing their own explanation of the picture. This is still not formal productive, mode of communication, but it is a mini practice for that.

What do we accomplish by this? First of all, we accomplish, understanding of such major concepts of literary analysis such as character and setting. And of course, The other major component of, literary analysis is understanding of plot. Understanding that Plot is not just a gibberish, an illogical sequence of events, but Actually, a very well connected cause and effect, sequence of, beginning, middle, and end. So plot, character, and setting, the three pillars of, literary analysis, reading and comprehension of literature.

And of course this can be applied to a non fictional text. An article on some historic event offers, a great opportunity to see how events come follow, one from the next to the next to the next. Scientific texts, performing a a a a lab, etcetera, all this is open to such sequencing by the students.

Speaker 2:

Absolutely. And the next Activity is an activity that is one of those tried and true, like the k w l. This Venn diagram is a real simple, graphic organizer. And here, what we Are inviting our students to do after they've done their their reading or or worked with the text, whether it's reading, viewing, or listening, is we ask them to make comparisons. We ask them to find similarities and differences.

And so here, of course, it's focused on the characters in in the story, from the ants and the cicada. And so we asked them to use the Venn diagram And to to to not just make comparisons, but to also provide that textual evidence for each entry. And so, we would model how this is completed with them, maybe giving them a start depending on proficiency level and age range of the students. You know your students best. And so we would guide them to Place in the middle the similarities between the two characters for this story, but then also to add that textual evidence to go back to the story, And to say we we actually would start with just having them identify the similarities, and then we would have them identify those differences on the outside.

And once they've done that, now we have them go back to the Venn diagram side. And once they've done that, now we have them go back to the Venn diagram and say, okay. Go to the text and provide evidence, for why where you found those similarities in the middle and where you found those differences on those outsides of the Venn diagram. And so, again, we're having students go back to the text multiple times with a different purpose each time working with the language that they're encountering there.

Speaker 1:

K. And, again, this is in preparation, this is in preparation for our students to interact among themselves in the collaborative mode of communication. They're preparing talking points for themselves, and They are, they are preparing for their productive. So this all this is like mini practice for what will follow.

Speaker 2:

I I think, Svetlana, we, should also maybe highlight, that when we're using these kinds of organizers that we're not just giving the students, supports, scaffolds, for for what we're asking them to do. But as the teacher, it also gives us an opportunity to formatively assess where they are with their understanding. And so these activities are more than just activities. What we're doing is ongoing formative assessment of their interpretive, skill development. And so that's, I think, super important to to highlight when we when we began day 1 and, and even in day 2 and talking about Backward design.

We mentioned that our focus will be mostly on formatively assessing development throughout the modes. And so Bringing it back to these activities also serve as formative assessments is a really important thing to keep in mind.

Speaker 1:

Absolutely. Our next Example of an activity, furthers our students', aims to further our students' standing of character, by, inviting them to assume the persona of a therapist, And through images and symbols or single words and single words, they will create the open mind of the ants and the cicada. We are offering them, this, graphic organizer, And kids usually draw beautiful eyes. They make a face out of this. They give it hair.

They it it's it's a it's they have a blast with this. But bottom line is that they have to fill up this, the oval of the representing the mind of the ants or the mind of the cicada with images of what makes this character this character. What is on the sicadas mind? Is it, Is it is it gathering, grain, or is it playing music? What what is on the ant's mind, etcetera etcetera.

It's so, again, minimal language production, but a lot of Yeah. Interpretation, a a lot of evidence of our students' interpretation of what they have read and understood and analyzed. This is no longer a regurgitation of facts, But it is, an entry an entrance in, to the level of analysis. Thank you so much. And, of course, they can cite textual evidence that, that supported that that supports this image that they're drawing.

Now the next the and this is, I believe, our last, activity, for the after the reading. This is what we call, a found poem. To the left, you see the the text of the story as you received it in the document. And then, in red, we have highlighted the important words that represent the ants and the cicada. And, using these words, the students can produce a found poem that is their manner, a very creative manner of, of analyzing who these characters are and how they interacted.

We have suggested the summer and winter division, And here's the found poem that, we created. In the old days, friends were very different. Summer. And again, this is a this is a found poem that, uses, that utilizes in a certain sequence, just words and phrases, but com put together, they bring the essence of the characters, the essence of the story, the essence of their interaction, and in a way, the main idea of the story.

Speaker 2:

I think for the students who need who prefer to have a creative outlet. An activity like this allows them to do that, in in ways that, writing a summary, for example, would not. Right?

Speaker 1:

That's right.

Speaker 2:

And and I wanted to just share, there was a question in the chat related to formative assessment, and just what information might we observe formatively and then use to make instructional decisions? And so I stayed I I was sharing A series of posts to answer that question related to the Venn diagram. But these are also I think when we're looking at any of these activities, It particularly, the organizers that we're looking at and that students are completing, we're able to see if what they are putting in those is on target, and we're able to see where we need to circle back, maybe re Teach to bring something new in, to support those who maybe need more. So so these activities give us Really, good way to be able to adjust instruction on the spot, including addressing misconceptions that are taking place as the students are doing the work too. So hopefully that helps, Melissa.

Let's see. I think, actually, this does bring us into our last practicum of the day. Right?

Speaker 1:

Correct. Correct.

Speaker 2:

Okay. So here we are, our last one of the day, and here you're going to still be focused on interpretive communication, and you'll focus on these after activities. So very similar instructions focusing on Those after activities, you are welcome again to use one of those from the models that were shared or to bring in your own, and modify it for 2 different proficiency levels. And, Svetlana, do we have time for 25 minutes For this or should we be we have we have sharing afterward.

Speaker 1:

I I think we are Okay. Let's do twin. No. I think we're good with 25 Because these are probably less familiar.

Speaker 2:

Perfect. So then we some of them. We some of them. So we'll open up the breakouts again for those of you who wanna work either independently or with your teams, and we'll bring you back in 25 minutes. Does that Put us at about 4 o'clock.

Is my clock correct? Exactly 4 o'clock. Yes. Perfect. Okay.

So, I will reopen those breakout room. Time on, sharing. Did we say 15?

Speaker 1:

Yeah. Yeah. 28 Because people will be in in rooms with others with whom they have not worked. So, there will be some unexpected, Uh-huh. Unfamiliar exchange of unfamiliar results.

Speaker 2:

Yes. And everyone is back from the breakout, so welcome back. I got to see little snips of Faces for a second. And we are going to, as we shared, you're gonna have the chance to move into, a sharing activity so that you can showcase all of the work that you have been Creating. And so today, you've been focused on the interpretive mode of communication, and we're going to move you into breakout rooms, that are mixed, not necessarily, by choice, but more of assigned manually rooms so that you can hopefully work with other people And and gain some new ideas, different perspectives.

And so when you get into your breakout with your new group, will you please make sure of course, say hello, introduce yourselves, all of that. But make sure to identify the targeted proficiency ranges, that you were targeting with the resources that you're sharing so that it's clear to everybody what you were doing. And so then just share What did you create for your before activity, your during activity, and for the after activity? Okay?

Speaker 1:

And I am I am sure that you are going to, share with everybody, on what, material, reading or visual or audio material you're basing your activities.

Speaker 2:

Perfect. I'm setting up the breakouts right now. I just need to I'm recreating them as we speak and, want to make sure that we They have oops. Sorry. Probably 3 to 4 in each room.

So, they are recreated now, and They are open for you, so we'll see you back in about 15 minutes, everybody. Alright. Everybody, welcome back from your breakout. What we're going to do is, on day 4, we have time allotted for you to be able to share basically what you've created from beginning to end with everybody. And so we want you to know that, kind of give you a heads up about that, for day 4.

Right now, we're going to pass the baton to Cena with Uflow, so that Cena can bring you into applying what you've been learning to practice using Uflow. Cena, it's all yours.

Speaker 6:

Hello, everyone. Uh-huh. Happy to be here and talk to you guys about Uflow. Thank you, Tanya, as well and Svetlana. Today was a very productive session, and we had a lot of interesting lessons to be learned and things to practice.

So, as you probably are aware, we will be you flow is basically one session behind, so we will be showing you all the things you can do now with, day 2. So let me share my screen, and we can get started. So we're back to the same page. It's accessible through the same link as before. Here we now have the last time we talked about foundations.

Now we're gonna talk about planning for learning. So you can see we have 2 lessons available for everyone to take a look. The first one is on language objectives and functions, And we had 2 learning objectives, that were related to defining language objectives and functions and creating standard based functional language objectives. As you might be aware and you probably remember, you can just click on the slides and it will take you to that page. And now here we have the slides just like before.

You can go through them and review them and, of course, annotate them as you see fit. On the left, we've talked about this as well. So We have a new summary for you guys to take a quick look at. And in addition to that, we also have some flashcards that are new as well. We spent a bit more time for this week to try and, enhance the flashcard experience and make sure that the flashcards that we're generating are more useful than day 1.

And so you can see you can see them here. We have, like, language functions. We have tiered vocabulary, and you can see all the 3 tiers and what they mean. We have backward design. And, of course let me make this a little bit.

That's better. Yeah. We have so constant objectives, communication focus language objectives, academic language functions, bloom's FIRP wheel that that we went through, And all of them, of course, are coming from the notes themselves. Now in addition to so we've talked about chat before, but we now have also a new tab called notes. And so we have, come up with a way where these language models can generate notes for you guys so that you can have a better, time reviewing the content.

And so you can see here, we were able to generate take the slides and the, actual session and and generate some bullet points for you guys to be able to quickly go through and recall, what were the things that were discussed. And there are examples that you can see and follow, and, of course, there are, different different information that is just easier to go through this than necessarily going through PowerPoint and maybe looking at a table like this Or maybe looking at a diagram like this. So we have them all put together for you in this really nice format, like and you can see here we have, like, Different artifacts, different modes of communication. And so you can quickly go through them this way. In addition so if we come back to, here.

So we also have the other lesson, the tiered vocabulary structures. So that one had only one learning objective. And the slides for it are also available here for you guys to take a look. And, the summary is the same between both of the lessons because we wanted to, you know, kind of combine them, but the flash cards will be different, and they're gonna be more focused here on tiered vocabularies, and the different language functions. And, of course, talking about the structures of communication.

You can see, you know, language specific approach to backward design and, You know, the different risk profiles, and the formative assessments, and authentic resources, and higher order thinking. So they're all available here and, of course, the notes are also targeted towards this lesson. So Yep. So you can see here, we have our language specific approach to backward design, tiered vocabulary, And, all the different things that you might want to do with can do statements and rubrics and summative planning. So they're all available here for you to quickly skim through, and learn from.

So that is it for my PowerPoint today Well, my presentation today. Thank you.

Speaker 0:

Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for spending another session with us. Your time is valuable, and we appreciate the investment you're making in your students and your community. As you think about language development, with our colleagues here today and you take it back to your colleagues at your sites and your districts, I'm going to be resharing, a couple of things. I'm gonna be sharing the link to today's survey, which will, give you access to today's slides at the end of the survey.

Additionally, I'll be selling, sharing the Liar for the continuing education units that will give you a little bit more information on the steps and logistics for, getting those continuing education units. And then, lastly, if anybody would like to share any of the artifacts or things that they created with their team or individually as a result of these sessions, please go ahead and share them in the chat Or reach out, to Sumin and share those links with us. We'd love to be able to share those in the participant Folders, so that you can see what others have been creating, and we can co construct and share those ideas, that we've been populating during these sessions. And I believe that that is all. Did I miss anything that we had said we were gonna talk about?

Speaker 2:

I don't think so, Melissa.

Speaker 0:

Okay. Great. There's a few item more items today than other days. So I'm gonna go ahead and share that, link now.

Speaker 2:

Wonderful. And Emas will reshare the link on building schema. And so I believe I put that in the chat Some time ago, but, hopefully, we can make sure that goes into the shared resources.

Speaker 0:

Yes. That actually reminds me, There there were a couple of conversations that populated some recommended readings, and so I've gone ahead and dropped those in a document called recommended reading. So there's a couple, and they're linked in that document for today's session. And that's all. Thank you.

Speaker 2:

I think Jennifer was asking if they'll get an email, like, last week. I just wanna

Speaker 0:

A follow-up email? I will ask, I will bring that to Suman's attention, and I'm certain that there will be a follow-up email.

Speaker 4:

It's just easier to print at school.

Speaker 2:

Okay.

Speaker 4:

I have, like, 4 reams of paper, and I I don't print anything. So I just I would rather print it at school On a good fast printer instead of my home slow printer.

Speaker 2:

Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, everybody, and enjoy your weekend. Thank you for staying with us, and, we look forward to seeing you next Saturday.

Bye.
