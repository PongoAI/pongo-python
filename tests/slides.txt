Learning Objectives
By the end of this presentation, you will be able to:
• Differentiate content, processes, and products necessary to meet the
specific developmental and communicative needs of students in the
interpretive mode of communication, and
• Explore models of a natural progression of activities that allow
students to make meaning of language and culture found within
authentic resources in order to advance their English language
proficiency in the interpretive mode of communication.

→ Emerging
English learners
enter the Emerging
level having limited
receptive and
productive English
skills.
As they progress
through the Emerg-
ing level, they start
to respond to more
varied communi-
cation tasks using
learned words and
phrases with in-
creasing ease.
Upon exit from
the Emerging
level, students
have basic English
communication
skills in social
and academic
contexts.
ELD Proficiency Level Continuum
→→ Expanding
As English learners
progress through
the Expanding
level, they move
from being able to
refashion learned
phrases and
sentences in
English to meet
their immediate
communication
and leaming needs
toward being able
to increasingly
engage in using the
English language
in more complex,
cognitively demand-
ing situations.
Upon exit from the
Expanding level,
students can use
English to learn
and communicate
about a range
of topics and
academic content
areas.
Bridging
As English learners
progress through
the Bridging level,
they move from
being able to
communicate
in ways that are
appropriate to
different tasks,
purposes, and
audiences in a
variety of social
and academic
contexts toward
being able to refine
and enhance their
English language
competencies in a
broader range of
contexts.
Upon exit from
the Bridging
level, students
can communicate
effectively with
various audiences
on a wide range of
familiar and new
topics to meet
academic demands
in a variety of
disciplines.
Lifelong Language
Learning
Students who have
reached "proficiency"
in the English language
(as determined by state
and/or local criteria) con-
tinue to build increasing
breadth, depth, and com-
plexity in comprehending
and communicating in
English in a wide variety
of contexts.

The Ant and the Cicada
In the old days, ants and cicadas were friends. They were very different.
The ants were hardworking, but the cicadas were lazy.
In the summer, the ant families were very busy. They knew that in the
winter they would have to stay in their anthill. They wanted to have enough
food for the whole winter.
While the ants worked hard, the cicadas didn't do anything. They sang
and danced all day. When they were hungry, they could fly to the farm and get
something to eat.
One day the cicadas were singing and dancing. They saw a long line of
ants bringing food to their anthill. The cicadas said, 'Stop, my silly friends. It's
a very nice day. Come and dance with us.' The ants said, 'Don't you know
about winter? If you don't work now, you'll have trouble later.'
But the cicadas said, 'We have strong wings. We can fly anywhere we
want. Stupid ants!" And they continued to sing and dance.
In the winter, it rained or snowed all the time, and it was very cold. In
the anthill, there was singing and dancing. But the cicadas had nothing to eat.
They asked the ants for some food. The ants said, 'We thought you could fly
anywhere. Now who is stupid and silly?
The cicadas cried and said that their wings were wet from the rain. The
ants said, 'We're sorry, but now it's too late. If we help you, there won't be
enough food for us. Sorry, very sorry.' And the ants closed their door.
The next day, when the ants opened their door, all the cicadas were
dead! That's why we can hear cicadas sing in the summer, but in the winter
they are silent.
